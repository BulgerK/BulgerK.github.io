Given the basic idea of a box, our four-person group was given the task to hack the box and create a new product that related to a social issue evident in today’s society. After much brainstorming and cooperation, the Modular Pillbox was born. Our target audience comprised of users managing their own medication with a goal of aiding against accidental overdose or missed doses. The pillbox redesign included improvements to its functionality, accessibility and ergonomics such as wall-hanging designed with removable compartments, whiteboard surfaces for customizability and even a Bluetooth connected app to help with regulation and organization of medicine.
