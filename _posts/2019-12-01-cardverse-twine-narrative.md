Utilizing Twine, I created an interactive, nonlinear story titled, Cardverse, which allowed the reader to determine their preferred path and story outcome. The coding elements of the tool allowed for formulating text and pictures. The story development required organizing blocks of text within the program to allow the flow of the story to be adaptable to the readers choices.

The storyline revolved around conflict within the land of cards where the reader must align themselves with a suit. Selection of suit leads to a different set of decisions and therefore endings. As author and coder, this narrative was received with positive feedback and a great mark on the assignment. The experience allowed me to express my creative side and use both my imaginative and technical skills to generate something everyone could enjoy.
