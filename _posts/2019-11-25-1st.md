  The idea for the proposed Electronic Interactive Textbook application was
  sparked by a personal experience where our class was unable to access the
  required electronic textbook. The deliverables included designing a concept,
  creating a plan with requirements and schedule, conducting research and
  usability testing, developing user persona and summarizing impacts and
  conclusions. The prototype was formed through a variety of card sorts and
  interview structured usability testing with the outcome providing an improved
  user-friendly application view. For my first UX Design project, I received
  outstanding marks and feedback including a request for my deliverables to be
  used as examples for the future classes.
