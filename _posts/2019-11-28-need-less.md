The Need>Less project was produced in partnership with a client to create an application to help distribute food, by connecting those with extra food to those in need while emphasizing a safe environment for all users. To ensure we were meeting their expectations, our project team collaborated with the client throughout the process reviewing requirements, identifying target audience, designing a plan, examining research findings and assessing the protype. The research methodology included investigating local needs and designing/delivering a questionnaire to shelters for feedback.

Our group combined abilities and worked together to create a viable prototype that was presented to the client. Careful consideration was implemented to address the sensitive issues and provide safety features. Client feedback was very positive indicating that we helped them take critical steps in direction of their vision.
